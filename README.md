# odin-recipes
In this project we are making a website which will list foods, and when you click on the food, it will link to a webpage with a picture of the food, as well as a unordered lsit of ingredients and an ordered list of steps. 

I am practicing using images, lists, links, github, as well as making commit within HTML
